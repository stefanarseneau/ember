## EMBER â€” Estimating Mass and Bolometric properties of Evolved Remnants

`ember` is a tool for fitting the spectral energy distribution of white dwarfs in Gaia. It works on calibrated BP/RP spectra, meaning that it is entirely native to Gaia-- no external survey data needed (unless you want it!). It also uses monte carlo sampling of MIST white dwarf cooling tracks to measure cooling ages and theoretical hydrogen layer masses.

**Installation:**

To install, run
